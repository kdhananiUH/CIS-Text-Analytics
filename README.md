## Topic Modelling on News Articles :writing_hand: :newspaper:

+ The data for this study was gathered in 2017 from 
Factiva, a huge Global News database, and 
includes items from the Wall Street Journal and 
the New York Times. Tokenizing and eliminating 
6
stop words are used to preprocess the articles. 

+ To 
extract topics from the corpus, the study used 
topic modeling with the LDA algorithm.
We were successfully able to remove the Meta 
data from the articles in the corpus and by using 
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm
we were able to determine the meaning topics 
from all of the articles from the given corpus.

+ Our in-depth analysis using topic modeling 
provides valuable insights into how traditional 
media outlets portray terrorist organizations. By 
identifying common themes and patterns in the 
each of the 10 topics , we can help journalists and 
researchers better understand the narrative 
surrounding terrorism in traditional media and 
potentially improve the quality of reporting on 
this complex and sensitive topic.

+ Our findings could expand the analysis to other 
media outlets or time periods to provide a more 
comprehensive understanding of the evolution of 
terrorism coverage over time.
